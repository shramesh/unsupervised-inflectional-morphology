# Unsupervised Model for Inflectional Morphology

This repo contains an extremely haphazard collection of jupyter notebooks for the experiments performed towards my term paper
for the wonderful course on [Computational Cognitive Modeling](https://blogs.umass.edu/linguist692c-jarosz/) taught by [Gaja Jarosz](https://blogs.umass.edu/jarosz/)

The [term paper](inflectional-morphology-word2vec-harsha.pdf) entitled *"Exploring the Utility of Distributed Representations in Unsupervised Learning of Morphology from Child-Directed Speech"* is an exposition on if and how effectively could word2vec model inflectional morphology learning during child language acquisition. It also has Gaja's review comments, which could be interesting future research directions.
